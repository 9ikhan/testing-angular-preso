###  Steps to run jasmine tests using karma-browserstack-launcher 
 
1. Set your BrowserStack `username` and `accessKey` in `karma.conf.js`
2. `npm install`
3. `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start`

**Note:** The repo is forked from [Problematic](https://github.com/Problematic/testing-angular-preso). I have only added the  karma-browserstack-launcher specific settings
